# How to implement a Transformer ?

The transformer architecture powers currently almost every state-of-the-art 
deep learning model. Here, we provide an implementation of the transformer 
architecture originally published by Vaswani et al. in 
["Attention is all you need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in 2017.
